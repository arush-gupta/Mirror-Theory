# Theory of Mirroring

This repository explores a psychological and emotional framework called the **Theory of Mirroring**. It examines how unmet childhood needs for recognition, emotional resonance, and attunement can create lifelong patterns of projection, self-doubt, and relational power struggles.

- Real-life implications of mirroring dysfunction
- Connection to negative self-talk, projection, and childhood trauma
- Role of power dynamics and emotional survival

## Overview

The theory proposes that when children do not receive appropriate emotional mirroring from caregivers or peers, they often internalize distorted self-images. These distortions can persist into adulthood, where individuals unconsciously seek validation, reflection, or emotional closure through romantic relationships, social admiration, or achievement.

Rather than being rooted in narcissism or insecurity alone, this pattern stems from a **deep survival need** to complete the original “mirroring loop.”

## Goals of this Project

- Offer a compassionate, structured model for understanding emotional projection and longing
- Provide language for people healing from chronic invalidation or relational wounding
- Serve as a foundation for further psychological exploration, writing, or inner work
